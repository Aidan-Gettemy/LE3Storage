# LE3Storage
This is a code space that I will use to manage some files for my leading edge erosion project.
I need to go through and carefully document what all these files are and what the different scripts do.
On a high level, the process is as follows:

- The first script creates a matrix of design points to run the simulator on
- The second script uses the library of set-up functions to run the simulator and organize the output
- The third script either explores the results, or builds a database from the completed runs
- Optional, the jointables script puts the datatables from the simulation together into one database
